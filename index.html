                            The first session, Images for Ideas, will take place via Zoom on Thursday Dec. 2nd @ 8pm. The second part of the series will be held in the spring semester 2022. Both sessions will utilize submissions by School of Art students as a springboard for a discussion of images as conceptual groundwork in pre-production and intuitive framing device in post-production. The two-part event is open to the University.
